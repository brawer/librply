## ABOUT

Originally written by Diego Nehab.
The PLY file format is widely used to store geometric information, such as 3D models,
but is general enough to be useful for other purposes.

## COMPILATION

For compilation of the library simply call

    % make

You can compile some example programs by calling

    % make tools

Finally, you can run some tests by calling

    % make test
